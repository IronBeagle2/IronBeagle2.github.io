        <p>In my free time, I make games. They are usually developed for only a month or so, but I'd like to do some
          more serious ones.</p>
          <h2>Sonic the Hedgehog GameBoy Port</h2>
          <p>
            A simple work in progress port of Sonic 1 to the GameBoy. More info coming soon.
          </p>
        <!--Space Game-->
        <h2>Space Game</h2>
        <p>The current project of mine. So far it has no official name so I just call it Space Game. It's a first person
          shooter, with graphics style straight from the 90s. You're in a spaceship controlled by an evil computer,
          who's sending evil robots towards you. You'll be able to play multiplayer with friends! It is heavily work in
          progress, but most of the mechanics are not finished at all.</p>

        <!--Zombsody 2D-->
        <h2>Zombsody 2D</h2>
        <p>
          Zombsody is a 2D top-down shooter game about going around a city and shooting zombies.
          It was originally made in under 8 hours as a personal challenge.
          With the help of NostalgiaModder, who made some really amazing textures, we're currently
          remaking the game. Every mechanic has already been added to the new project. All that's missing are animations
          and more levels. <a href="https://dejvoss.cz/games/zombsody/" >Read more...</a>
