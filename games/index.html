        <h2>Zombsody 2D</h2>
        <p>
          Zombsody is a 2D top-down shooter game about going around a city and shooting zombies.
          It was originally made in under 8 hours as a personal challenge.
          With the help of NostalgiaModder, who made some really amazing textures, we're currently
          remaking the game. Every mechanic has already been added to the new project. All that's missing are animations
          and more levels. <a href="https://dejvoss.cz/games/zombsody/">Read more...</a>
        </p><br>

        <h2>Space Game</h2>
        <p>An unfinished first person shooter with pixelated graphics style straight from the 90s. The game is no longer
          in development, but I might return to it sometimes. Here's some story, that wasn't implemented:<br>You are an
          astronaut who arrives on an orbit station "121-Alpha". The station is controlled by a robot (who's name I
          haven't made yet), who acts like a regular autopilot, but in reality, he controlls evil robots who infested
          the entire base. It is your duty to kill all the robots, and then face the final boss of the game (the main
          evil robot).<br>The game was meant to be played in singleplayer or multiplayer.<br>You can try the alpha
          version <a href="https://dejvoss.cz/games/space-game/">here</a>.</p>
