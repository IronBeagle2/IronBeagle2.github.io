		<b>0.3.0</b> (18th March 2021)
		<p>
			Made a better looking test room. There's a lot of trees around! =) I did some testing with item interaction,
			but haven't added it yet.
		</p>
		<b>0.2.5</b> (18th March 2021)
		<p>
			Items update! There is a bunch of them in one corner of the ground. Also apples are on trees! You still
			can't interact with them, that's coming soon. I attempted fixing the sprite issue, but had no luck. Spam Q
			to spawn balls!
		</p>
		<b>0.2.0</b> (18th March 2021)
		<p>
			Free mouse look! Skybox! Walls! Tree is no longer in the ground. Added a fun little ball you can push around
			and
			test physics with it. The sprite overlaying issue is still not fixed.
		</p>
		<b>0.1.0 Hotfix</b> (8th December 2020)
		<p>
			Enabled camera object, and the game is no longer in fullscreen by default. The resolution is now the sweet
			640x480! =)
		</p>
		<b>0.1.0</b> (8th December 2020)
		<p>
			Added movement, ground, one zombie (doesn't do anything yet) and a tree, which is glitched and is in the
			ground. Zombie sprite can be seen even when it's behind the tree.
		</p>
