		<b>0.5.2 Hotfix</b> (6 May 2021)

			Oops! The mouse can now be released again in the desktop version by pressing Esc.
		</p>
		<b>0.5.2</b> (6 May 2021)
		<p>
			UI and Performace upgrade! Balls now randomly change colours! Compiled a MacOS version as well! Thanks
			Lifeisstrange47 for testing!
		</p>
		<b>0.5.1</b> (6 May 2021)
		<p>
			Spawn menu - Hold Q! Had to disable the grass because it lagged the WebGL build a lot. I'll figure out a
			better way to do it.
		</p>
		<b>0.5.0</b> (6 May 2021)
		<p>
			Multi-platform support! =) Compiled a WebGL build alongside with the Windows one! Play section updated!

		<b>Testing a WebGL version.</b> (6 May 2021)
		<p>
			Should be up very soon. =)
		</p>
		<b>0.4.5</b> (4 May 2021)
		<p>
			Item interactions testing. I can't get it to work the way I want...
		</p>
		<b>0.4.0</b> (4 May 2021)
		<p>
			Testing grass and pillars. Some performance improvements.
		</p>
		<b>0.3.0</b> (22 April 2021)
		<p>
			Made a better looking test room. There's a lot of trees around! =) I did some testing with item interaction,
			but haven't added it yet.
		</p>
		<b>0.2.5</b> (22 April 2021)
		<p>
			Items update! There is a bunch of them in one corner of the ground. Also apples are on trees! You still
			can't interact with them, that's coming soon. I attempted fixing the sprite issue, but had no luck. Spam Q
			to spawn balls!
		</p>
		<b>0.2.0</b> (21 April 2021)
		<p>
			Free mouse look! Skybox! Walls! Tree is no longer in the ground. Added a fun little ball you can push around
			and

		</p>
		<b>0.1.0 Hotfix</b> (8 December 2020)
		<p>
			Enabled camera object, and the game is no longer in fullscreen by default. The resolution is now the sweet
			640x480! =)

		<b>0.1.0</b> (8 December 2020)
		<p>
			Added movement, ground, one zombie (doesn't do anything yet) and a tree, which is glitched and is in the
			ground. Zombie sprite can be seen even when it's behind the tree.
