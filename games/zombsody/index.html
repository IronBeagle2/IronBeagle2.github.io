      Zombsody 2D is a top-down shooter where you play as a survivor of a zombie apocalypse. Your goal is to kill
      all zombies in a city that your family lives in, and hopefully find them alive hiding in a basement.
      The game is still heavily under development, but it's slowly but surely coming along. You can try playing the Demo
      version, which contains the Arena game mode - kill as many as you can!

    <h4>Trivia</h4>
    <p>
      Zombsody 2D was originally made in around 5 hours as a personal challenge.
      Special Thanks goes to: NostalgiaModder for creating most of the textures, SteleCat for coming up with the
      game's name, and the rest of Club Classic Revived for beta testing and giving me feedback on the game.<br>
