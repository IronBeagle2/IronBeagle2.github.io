        <p>In my free time, I make games. They are usually developed for only a month or so, but I'd like to do some
          more serious ones.</p>
        <!--Space Game-->
        <h2>Space Game</h2>
        <p>The current project of mine. So far it has no official name so I just call it Space Game. It's a first person
          shooter, with graphics style straight from the 90s. You're in a spaceship controlled by an evil computer,
          who's sending evil robots towards you. You'll be able to play multiplayer with friends! It is heavily work in
          progress, but most of the mechanics are not finished at all.</p>

        <h2>Zombsody 2D</h2>
        <date>Last update: 13. 12. 2020 (14:04)</date>
        <p>
          Zombsody is a 2D top-down shooter game about going around a city and shooting zombies.
          It was originally made in under 8 hours as a personal challenge.
          With the help of NostalgiaModder, who made some really amazing textures, we're currently
          remaking the game. Every mechanic has already been added to the new project. All that's missing are animations
          and more levels.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can play the bad original (Which i highly don't recommend)
          <a href="https://dejvoss.cz/Games/Zombsody/PreAlpha/">here.</a>
          <br>You can download a development version of the updated one <a
            href="https://dejvoss.cz/Games/Zombsody/Dev/">here.</a>
          Keep in mind that it is still not finished. <br>There are a lot of features planned, like more guns,
          customizable
          character, different game modes, and even a level editor.
        </p>
        <p>
          Special Thanks goes to: NostalgiaModder for helping me with the textures, SteleCat for coming up with the
          game's name, and the entire Club Classic Revived for beta testing and giving me feedback on the game.
