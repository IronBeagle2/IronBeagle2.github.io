        <p>In my free time, I make games. They're usually not much fun, so they fail. Here are some of my projects I am
          working on or I worked on before:</p> <br>
        <h2>Space Game</h2>
        <p>The current project of mine. So far it has no official name so I just call it Space Game. It's a first person
          shooter, with graphics style straight from the 90s. You're in a spaceship controlled by an evil computer,
          who's sending evil robots towards you. You'll be able to play multiplayer with friends! It is heavily work in
          progress, but most of the mechanics are not finished at all. (A demo will probably come out on Christmas, so
          stay tuned!)</p><br>
        <h2>Zombsody 2D</h2>
        <p>
          Originally made in under 8 hours, a simple 2D top-down game about going around a city and shooting zombies.
          I'd like to expand on it and add stuff like campaign mode, arena mode, level editor, more guns, etc...
          You can play the original (Crappy one, made under 8 hours as said before, not recommended) <a
            href="https://dejvoss.cz/Games/Zombsody/PreAlpha/">here.</a>
          You can play the better updated version here. (Coming soon.)
        </p><br>
