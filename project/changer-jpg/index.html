      <h3>How I made it</h3>
      <p>
        I was experimenting with image file formats such as .PNG, .JPG, etc.. The out of boredom i decided to delete a
        bunch of data from the image using a text editor, and i created something weird. It's a JPG image, that changes
        every time you upload it on Discord. I first noticed some weird behaviour when i saved the image - it looked
        green on my desktop, but when i opened it (with the default image opener in Windows 10) it showed as green for a
        second and then quickly flashed and changed to yellow. I wanted to show this weird image to my friend, so i sent
        it to him on Discord. Then i saw it. The image looked completely different again! I tried sending it to a
        different friend, and the image looked different again.
      </p>
      <h3>How to use this file?</h3>
      <p>
        First of all, you have to download the corrupted image <a
          href="http://dejvoss.cz/project/changer-jpg/changer.zip">here</a>. Extract it, and send it to someone over
        discord. I have tried other platforms but it doesn't seem to work there. As you can see, the sent image looks
        completely different than the one you downloaded. Pretty weird isn't it?
