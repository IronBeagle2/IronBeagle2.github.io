		<h4>Website has beed rebuilt! (21.5.2021)</h4>
		<p>
			Finally I got myself to somewhat remake the website - everything looks the same, but the CSS isn't such a
			mess anymore! =) I've also remade the structure of HTML a little. As you can see, the text got bigger and
			everything is properly centered! I've also started working on a few new games:<br>
			First off, there is <a href="https://dejvoss.cz/games/escape">Escape</a>. It is a Retro-Styled 2.5D game on
			the style of Wolf3d. There will be guns. There will be enemies. Stay tuned!<br>
			Then, there is <a href="https://dejvoss.cz/games/chambered">Legend of the Chambered</a>. It is a work in
			progress remake of a game made by Markus Persson (Notch).<br>
			I hope to make a post here at least every month, to keep everyone updated. =)

		<h4>Some news (30. 12. 2020)</h4>
		<p>
			Hello again. I am making some really small progress on Zombsody, and I will try to release it on the first
			of
			january 2021, however I can not promise anything. Another decision I made is that what I'll release will be
			a
			demo, not the final game, because I have much more plans for the release of 1.0.
			<br>Also, merry late Christmas! Hope ya'll doing good and spending time with your families. Until next time!

		<h4>SSD is here! (21. 12. 2020)</h4>
		<p>
			Hello! Not much happen in the past week, but I have the SSD running - finally. Recently I have been
			experimenting with writing my own game engines in Java and C++, and it is really fun. Not much progress
			happen
			on Zombsody2D, but that will change tomorrow. I've also been doing some preparations for that RPG i
			mentioned
			in my previous post.
			<br>That's all there is for today.

		<h4>Welcome to my new blog! (13. 12. 2020)</h4>
		<p>
			Hello! This is my first blog entry, I hope I will be putting news and stuff here every week or so. Currently
			I
			am having troubles with hardware on my main PC, my SSD died yesterday (don't worry, I didn't loose much
			important stuff, the only thing that I will really miss is the source code for some of my 2016 games which I
			have the .exes of), and my CPU is slowly but surely nearing it's end. Hopefully I will be
			able to get new drive as soon as possible so I can continue with my game development. Also recently teamed
			up
			with a texture artist - NostalgiaModder.
		</p>
		<p>
			Current plans are:
			<li>Finish Zombsody2D before Christmas</li>
			<li>Continue Development of Space Game</li>
			<li>Make a new project which I've been discussing with my texture artist. It will be a short first person
				RPG.
			</li>
			<li>Start making a new 2d game - a survival one.</li>
			I have much more plans than that, but I will keep them as a secret for now.
			<br>That is everything I have to say so far, see ya next time!
