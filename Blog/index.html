        <h2>Welcome to my new blog!</h2>
        <time>13. 12. 2020 (12:06)</time>
        <p>
          Hello! This is my first blog entry, I hope I will be putting news and stuff here every week or so. Currently I
          am having troubles with hardware on my main PC, my SSD died yesterday (don't worry, I didn't loose much
          important stuff, the only thing that I will really miss is the source code for some of my 2016 games which I
          have the .exes of), and my CPU is slowly but surely nearing it's end. Hopefully I will be
          able to get new drive as soon as possible so I can continue with my game development. Also recently teamed up
          with a texture artist - NostalgiaModder.
        </p>
        <p>
          Current plans are:
          <li>Finish Zombsody2D before Christmas</li>
          <li>Continue Development of Space Game</li>
          <li>Make a new project which I've been discussing with my texture artist. It will be a short first person RPG.
          </li>
          <li>Start making a new 2d game - a survival one.</li>
          I have much more plans than that, but I will keep them as a secret for now.
          <br>That is everything I have to say so far, see ya next time!
